Just a simple set of backup scripts to keep daily snapshots of 
databases (mysql/postgres), /etc and /home

run the install_backups file or 
copy the files to /etc/default and /etc/cron.daily, 
edit the /etc/default/backup* files

then run the /etc/cron.daily/backup* files to make an initial
backup and make sure everything works properly.
